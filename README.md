#slop-wayland

A wayland port of slop. It's currently a work in progress.

TODO:
- [ ] Window Selection (CURRENTLY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT HACKS/EXPLOITS/EXTENSIONS, Wayland is too secure)
- [ ] Magnification (UNLIKELY, again due to wayland being very secure)
- [x] Keyboard
- [x] Shaders
- [x] Custom output formatting
- [ ] Themes
- [ ] Multi-monitor testing (Pretty sure it won't work properly with multiple monitors, still needs to spawn a fullscreen window for each output.)
- [ ] Manpages
- [x] Option parsing
- [x] Highlighting
- [x] Mouse stuff
- [x] Drawing stuff
- [x] Printing stuff
