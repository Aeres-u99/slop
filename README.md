#slop-release-candidate

Since I made slop when I was around 16, it is *really bad*.

This just a re-write with less dependencies, inaccuracies, etc.

TODO:
- [x] Window Selection
- [x] Keyboard
- [x] Shaders
- [x] Custom output formatting
- [ ] Manpages
- [x] Option parsing
- [x] Highlighting
- [x] Mouse stuff
- [x] Drawing stuff
- [x] Printing stuff
- [ ] Librarify (so I can plug it into maim)

Avoiding:
- [ ] Themes (Not going to happen. It'd add a texture library dependency.)
- [ ] Magnification (Very expensive, probably not going to happen.)
